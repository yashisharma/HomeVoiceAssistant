# HomeVoiceAssistant

I used a number of libraries:
https://github.com/api-ai/api-ai-python
  VAD.py
  __init__.py
  apiai.py
  resampler.py
https://github.com/McSwindler/python-milight

If I forgot to credit you, please send me a message so I can add you!

I'll update this a bit later, but this is a voice assistant that I made to control my house's lights and outlets, as well as serving as a scheduler, pet manager, security system, etc.
